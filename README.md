# rde-veritest
A Progressive Web App for use in verifying some of the boundary conditions of the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test, using the JavaScript Geolocation API.

The main product of my Final Year Project (dissertation) at Loughborough University, as part of my MEng Aeronatical Engineering degree.  The application utilises the JavaScript Geolocation API to calculate distance travelled and speed in real time. This data is then analysed as per the latest EU RDE Regulation (RDE-4, Regulation EU 2018/1832) to check the validity of 11 of the test requirements. The UI then presents the results of this verification process concisely to the user, using audio and visual alerts. The application is a proof of concept, which aims to indicate the capability of existing smartphone and PWA technology to solve upcoming engineering challenges.

The project is created in React and uses Create-React-App.
